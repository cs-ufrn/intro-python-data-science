Pandas has quickly became an important tool in a data professional's toolbelt and is the most popular library for working with tabular data in Python. Tabular data is any data that can be represented as rows and columns. \n","\n","To represent tabular data, Pandas uses a custom data structure called a **DataFrame**. A DataFrame is a highly efficient, 2-dimensional data structure that provides a suite of methods and attributes to quickly explore, analyze, and visualize data. The DataFrame is similar to the NumPy 2D array but adds support for many features that help you work with tabular data.\n","\n","One of the biggest advantages that Pandas has over NumPy is the **ability to store mixed data types** in rows and columns. Many tabular datasets contain a range of data types and Pandas DataFrames handle mixed data types effortlessly while NumPy doesn't. Pandas DataFrames **can also handle missing values gracefully** using a custom object, **NaN**, to represent those values. A common complaint with NumPy is its lack of an object to represent missing values and people end up having to find and replace these values manually. In addition, pandas DataFrames contain axis labels for both rows and columns and enable you to refer to elements in the dataframe more intuitively. Since many tabular datasets contain column titles, this means that dataframes preserve the metadata from the file around the data.\n","\n","## Our case study\n","\n","In this part of the course, you'll learn the basics of pandas while exploring a dataset from the [the World Resources Institute and Google Earth Outreach.](https://github.com/WRI/global-power-plant-database). This dataset is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world.Each column in the dataset shows a different attribute of the powerplant and each row describes a different powerplant.\n","\n","Here are some of the columns in the dataset:\n","\n","- **country** - 3 character country code.\n","- **country_long** - longer form of the country designation.\n","- **name** - name of the powerplant.\n","- **gppd_idnr** - 10 or 12 character identifier for the power plant.\n","- **capacity_mw** - electrical generating capacity in megawatts.\n","- **latitude** - geolocation of power plant.\n","- **longitude** - geolocation of power plant.\n","- **fuel1** - energy source used in electricity generation.\n","- **fuel2** - energy source used in electricity generation.\n","- **fuel3** - energy source used in electricity generation.\n","- **fuel4** - energy source used in electricity generation.\n","- **comissioning_year** - year of plant operation\n","- **owner** - majority shareholder of the power plant\n","- **source** - entity reporting the data; could be an organization, report, or document\n","- **ulr** - web document corresponding to the `source` field\n","- **geolocation_source** - attribution for geolocation information\n","- **year_of_capacity_data** - year the capacity information was reported\n","- **generation_gwh_2013** - electricity generation in gigawatt-hours reported for the year 2013.\n","- **generation_gwh_2014** - electricity generation in gigawatt-hours reported for the year 2014.\n","- **generation_gwh_2015** - electricity generation in gigawatt-hours reported for the year 2015.\n","- **generation_gwh_2016** - electricity generation in gigawatt-hours reported for the year 2016.\n","- **estimated_generation_gwh** - estimated annual electricity generation in gigawatt-hours for the year 2014\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"dtD77ne85lo2","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## First steps with pandas\n","\n","### Importing the library\n","\n","First of all, we need to import the **pandas** library into the environment.
